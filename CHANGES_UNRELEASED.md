## General

### ⚠️ Breaking changes ⚠️

- The bundled version of Nimbus SDK has been updated to v0.6.0, which includes
  the following breaking changes:
  - Removed `NimbusClient.resetEnrollment`.
  - `NimbusClient.{updateExperiments, optInWithBranch, optOut, setGlobalUserParticipation}` now return a list of telemetry events.
    Consumers should forward these events to their telemetry system (e.g. via Glean).
  - Removed implicit fetch of experiments on first use of the database. Consumers now must
    call update_experiments explicitly in order to fetch experiments from the Remote Settings
    server.


### What's Changed

- The bundled version of Glean has been updated to v33.7.0.
- Various third-party dependencies have been updated to their latest versions.
